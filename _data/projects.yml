#     Engage me was a week long final project at <a href='devbootcamp.com'>DevBootcamp</a>. With the help of the Microsoft Cognitive Services API, my team was able to display people's emotions in real time, giving the presenter an overview of how they are doing in real time, as well as the ability to look at the audience's emotion-data after the presentation to see shifts in emotions over time.
#   technologies: It's build with HTML5, CSS, javaScript, a ruby on rails back-end, jQuery and materialize for forms and styling and Charts.js for the data-visualization. Hosted on heroku.

#   long_description: >
#     This project was carried out in groups of 5 students during the month of January 2022. The aim was to compile a new computer language named Deca inspired by Java. The purpose of this language is purely educational.
#     A big part of the work was to master the theory of languages. The understanding of the vocabulary and of the different grammar rules allowing to interpret the key words of the code and their actions was essential. We used the ANTLR tool to manage the vocabulary and grammar rules of the code.
#     A set of Java classes had to be developed to decorate the tree representing the Deca program. This decoration is used to know which actions (assembly code) the compiler must perform: display, loop, condition, declaration of variables, method or class ...
#     We used semi-agile working methods to be able to compile more and more developed subparts of the language by successive iterations. We started by implementing the basic principles of the language such as variable declaration, display functions, conditional statements ...
#     A lot of tests were necessary to verify that each new implementation could still compile the previous ones.

#   A work on multi-agents systems.
#   long_description: >
#     The project is dedicated to the study of the properties of multi-agent systems.
#     The first part consisted in developing a simulator of balls which move in a window, and which bounce on the a window, and which bounce on the edges.
#     The second part consisted in developing two games of cellular automata: the game of Conway's life and the immigration game. Afterwards we realized a slightly different model of cellular automaton slightly different, but wanting to be more realistic which is the model of segregation of Schelling which aims at simulating the phenomenon of segregation within a population.
#     The third part presents a model of swarms: the boids. The objective this time is to to add interaction between cellular agents.

#     This simple project aimed to give me a better understanding of jQuery. It was a part of an online course I took on <a href='udemy.com'>udemy</a> that got me interested in programming in the first place. It was also a good way to practice form submission error messages managed by javaScript, and explore different ways they could be accomplished.

#     I made this before I knew of various CSS styling libraries. It could look better, but I think learning to do CSS helped me understand web design much better. I'm comfortable with facing styling challenges that materialize or bootstrap doesn't have an answer for. I also learned to appreciate what these libraries do for me, especially in terms of positioning. Floats are notorious for being difficult to work with and grid system these libraries are offering are invaluable.

#     This project is mostly focused on learning/practicing react. React seems to be a very popular framework for front-end web development. I also was mind blown with how fast changes take place and the simplicity with which items can be rerendered with simple change of state (before this it could be quite a pain to try and append appropriate elements in appropriate places after an ajax call). So far the hardest part was to configure my environment with node, npm and nvm.

#     I learned of jekyll from a mentor at Dev Bootcamp, and based on her enthusiasm for the framework decided to try it. While building this site I've was able to pick up a lot of cool concepts as well as learn some new technologies, such as making bash scripts, using sass, as well as building, maintaining and troubleshouting a live site with attention to user experience, generating content and desighning layout. I extracted a lot of hardcoded data so that this site can be easily cloned/forked on github and adopted to be used by someone else.
